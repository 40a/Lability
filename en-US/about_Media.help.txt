SHORT DESCRIPTION
        Additional custom media/images can be used to either supplement the default built-in media or to override
        the built-in media with alternative media/images.
    
LONG DESCRIPTION
        By default, Conflab only includes evaluation media (and will automatically download this if it is not present
        on the host machine). If you wish to use VLK or MAK media you must provide your own media.
        
        You can also override the default media with your own implementation(s). This is useful if you have an existing
        image that you wish to use instead of the built-in media or wish to specify a shared file server in a team
        environment.
            
        Additional media can be added to the default Conflab media either by registering it (in advance) in the host's
        configuration or by defining it within the PowerShell DSC configuration (.psd1) document. The following custom
        media types are supported:
        
            * VHD
            * WIM
            * ISO
        
        This media can be downloaded from a web server or from an accessible file server as long as it is contactable
        from the host machine. NOTE: YOU CAN MANUALLY DOWNLOAD/PLACE MEDIA ON THE HOST MACHINE IF NEEDED.
        
        Conflab natively supports all Windows operating systems that include the Windows Management Framework (WMF) v4
        or later: Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. To support earlier operating
        systems, for example Windows 7, registering custom images is required.

        DSC must already be installed in VHD(X) images - supports Win 7, 2008 R2, Win 8 and 2012
        WMF 4+ must already be included for ISO images - does not support Win 7, 2008 R2, Win 8 and 2012
        DSC hotfixes must be specified for WMF 4 images (if not included in the image already)
