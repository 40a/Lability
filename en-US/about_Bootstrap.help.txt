SHORT DESCRIPTION
        A virtual machine is customised during the deployment process by injecting a custom bootstrap. This process
        can be extended to support nearly any scenario, if required.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        Conflab will deploy virtual machines (VMs) from a master/parent image. Each virtual machine (VM) master/
        parent image should be prepared correctly (typically via Sysprep) before deployment. When a VM is deployed,
        Conflab will customise the virtual machine by using a custom bootstrap. The bootstrap is applied at the end of
        the deployment process and, by default, initiates the PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) Local
        Configuration Manager (LCM) configuration process.
        
        If needed, this custom bootstrap process can be extended either within the media's definition and/or within a
        node's configuration. For example, desktop Operating Systems do not have the local Administrator account
        enabled and PowerShell Remoting disabled. A customised bootstrap is included in the built-in client Operating
        System images' configurations to enable the local Administrator account and enable PowerShell Remoting after
        the Unattend.xml file has been applied.
        
        The following default bootstrap is applied to all virtual machines deployed by Conflab (other than Nano Server
        images).
        
        {
            ## VirtualEngine.Lab DSC Bootstrap
            $VerbosePreference = 'Continue';
            $DebugPreference = 'Continue';
            Start-Transcript -Path "$env:SystemDrive\BootStrap\BootStrap.log" -Force;

            certutil.exe -addstore -f "Root" "$env:SYSTEMDRIVE\BootStrap\LabRoot.cer";
            ## Import the .PFX certificate with a blank password
            "" | certutil.exe -f -importpfx "$env:SYSTEMDRIVE\BootStrap\LabClient.pfx";

            <#CustomBootStrapInjectionPoint#>

            if (Test-Path -Path "$env:SystemDrive\BootStrap\localhost.meta.mof") {
                Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path "$env:SystemDrive\BootStrap\" -Verbose;
            }

            while ($true) {
                ## Replay the configuration until the LCM takes it!
                try {
                    if (Test-Path -Path "$env:SystemDrive\BootStrap\localhost.mof") {
                        Start-DscConfiguration -Path "$env:SystemDrive\Bootstrap\" -Force -Wait -Verbose -ErrorAction Stop;
                    }
                    break;
                }
                catch {
                    Write-Error -Message $_;
                    Start-Sleep -Seconds 5;
                }
            } #end while
            
            Stop-Transcript;
        }
        
        An additional custom bootstrap can be injected into the default bootstrap script block. It is inserted into the
        template scriptblock at the `<#CustomBootStrapInjectionPoint#>` marker above.
    
MEDIA BOOTSTRAP
        If an image/media requires additional configuration during the deployment process, a custom bootstrap can be
        defined within the media's CustomData hashtable.
        
        NOTE: THE BUILT-IN WINDOWS 8.1 AND WINDOWS 10 MEDIA INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CUSTOM BOOTSTRAP.
        
        The following example adds a custom bootstrap:
        
        $customData = @{
            CustomBootstrap = @(
                '## Unattend.xml will set the Administrator password, but it won''t enable the account on client OSes',
                'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force;',
                '## Kick-start PowerShell remoting on clients to permit applying DSC configurations',
                'Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force;'
            )
        }
        Register-LabMedia -Id CustomBootstrap -CustomData $customData ...
        
        NOTE: THE MEDIA CUSTOM BOOTSTRAP IS SPECIFIED AS A STRING ARRAY [STRING[]]

NODE BOOTSTRAP
        If an individual node requires additional configuration during the deployment process, a custom bootstrap can
        be defined within the node's configuration data. The following example shows enabling the local Administrator
        account and enabling PowerShell Remoting as these are not enabled by default on Windows client Operating
        Systems.
        
        NOTE: THIS IS ALREADY INCLUDED FOR THE BUILT-IN CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEMS' MEDIA AND IS SHOWN AS AN EXAMPLE.
        
        @{
            AllNodes = @(
                NodeName       = 'CLIENT1';
                Media          = 'Win81_x64_Enterprise_EN_Eval';
                CutomBootStrap = @'
                    ## Unattend.xml will set the Administrator password, but it won't enable the account on client OSes
                    NET USER Administrator /active:yes;
                    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force;
                    ## Kick-start PowerShell remoting on clients to permit applying DSC configurations
                    Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force;
'@
            )
        }
        
        NOTE: THE NODE CUSTOM BOOTSTRAP IS SPECIFIED AS A [STRING] TYPE, NOT A STRING ARRAY [STRING[]]

BOOTSTRAP ORDER
        If a custom bootstrap is specified in both the media's definition and on a node's bootstrap, the media-
        specific bootstrap is applied during deployment first, followed by the node's custom bootstrap.
        
        You can change the default custom bootstrap order using the `Set-LabVMDefault` command. The following options
        are available on the `Set-LabVMDefault -CustomBootstrapOrder` command:
        
            * Disabled
            * ConfigurationFirst
            * ConfigurationOnly
            * MediaFirst
            * MediaOnly
            
       The default custom bootstrap order can also be overridden in a node's configuration.
